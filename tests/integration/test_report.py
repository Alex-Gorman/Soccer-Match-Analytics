"""Integration test: end-to-end render of the HTML report.

This verifies the Stage-1 pipeline can:
  1) normalize a minimal raw match row,
  2) compute summary metrics, and
  3) render an HTML report to disk that contains the expected heading.

Run all integration tests:
    pytest tests/integration -q
Run only this file:
    pytest tests/integration/test_report.py -q
